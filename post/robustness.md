Robustness {#sec:robustness}
==========

Definition
----------

Robustness generally refers to the ability of a system’s function to persist under perturbation.
Biological systems exhibit robustness on three levels, as identified in @Richter2015EvolvabilitySurvey:

1.
 system functionality is not degraded by stochastic fluctuations in the system, \[item:robustness\_stochastic\]

2.
 phenotypic traits are generally not degraded by genetic variation, and \[item:robustness\_genetic\]

3.
 the phenotype is able to function if environment changes.
\[item:robustness\_environment\]

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

By reducing outright mortality and other phenotypic variations with catastrophic fitness implications, robustness biases evolutionary search towards viable variation.

Example
-------

The heart provides a prime example of level \[item:robustness\_stochastic\] robustness.
The waves of electric potential that govern the function of the heart are generally robust to perturbation; the heart can usually recover from momentary disruptions to these waves and resume normal function after a short time.
However, the heart is not a totally robust organ: it can be susceptible to ventricular fibrillation, where normal heart function is essentially halted by the emergence of a spiral wave pattern of electrical activation \[cite\].
In many cases, the consequences of the heart not being able to recover from the perturbation that induced the spiral wave pattern of activation are fatal.

Duplicate genes exemplify robustness at level \[item:robustness\_genetic\] @Gu2003EvolutionMutations.
It has been shown that deletion duplicate genes have a significantly lower proportion of fatal outcomes and a significantly higher proportion of weak or no effect outcomes in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast) @Gu2003EvolutionMutations.
Robustness is also provided by alternate metabolic pathways and regulatory networks that can compensate for the absence of a gene @Gu2003EvolutionMutations.

Finally, robustness at level \[item:robustness\_environment\] is exhibited by the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*).
This creature has been wildly successful in a wide range of environments — today, its range spans nearly the entire globe — that differ vastly from the environment where it originated @Wikipediacontributors2016BrownRat.
In fact, *Rattus norvegicus* is particularly notorious for thriving in urban areas, a completely novel environment that only came into existence in their current form over the last millennium or so.
The brown rat displays impressive robustness to environmental variation.
