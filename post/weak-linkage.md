Weak Linkage
============

Definition
----------

The concept of weak linkage is predicated on a distinction between instructive and enabling signals [[Downing, 2015, p 210]](#Downing2015IntelligenceSystems).
Instructive signals contain significant amounts of information about the process to be performed, not just information that a process should be performed.
In contrast, enabling signals are concise; the only information they contain is that the process should be performed.
In an enabling signal scheme, information characterizing a response to the signal is stored in the system that receives the signal and not in the signal itself [[Kirschner and Gerhart, p 283]](#Kirschner2005TheDilemma).
Weak linkage refers to interaction of subsystems of a biological organism coordinated by enabling, rather than instructive, signals.

Let us examine an economic analogy based around a hypothetical bakery to tease apart the difference between instructive and enabling signaling.
Suppose the bakery has a telephone.
Detailed instructions delivered over the telephone about the recipes, ingredient sources, and a schedule for production that should be used would be considered an instructive signal.
Consider if, instead, the baker were to adjust his production based solely on the frequency with which the telephone rang throughout the day.
Under this scheme, bakery output can still be influenced by external signals.
However, the amount of information required to signal the bakery is reduced.
Instead of needing to communicate recipes, ingredient sources, and a schedule for production, external sources just need to know the telephone number for the bakery.
Thus, such a scheme would be considered enabling signaling.
A collection of industries in small town coordinated by such enabling, rather than instructive, signals would be said to exhibit weak linkage.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

With simple signaling protocols, the probability of mutation establishing interaction between two systems via signaling is increased.
Of particular interest is the role of weak linkage in allowing an externally triggered signal to become innate.
On a cellular level, many environmental signals, such as the concentration of a certain chemical compound in an organism’s environment, are of an enabling nature.
Environmental enabling signals can often be mimicked by the cell itself and are therefore accessible to becoming innately triggered [[Downing, 2015, p 210]](#Downing2015IntelligenceSystems).
This scheme provides a plausible for phenotypic traits that are originally environmentally-induced (i.e.
indirect plasticity, see Section \[sec:indirect\_plasticity\]) to be incorporated on a permanent, heritable basis.

Additionally, under a weak signaling regime information required to perform a process is more tightly contained within the context of the subsystem that performs the process.
Thus, weak signaling promotes modularity.

Example
-------

In the grossest terms, a neuron consists of an input component, which is responsive to the presence of a specific subset of neurotransmitters, and output, which releases a different specific subset of neurotransmitters.
The specific subsets of neurotransmitters a neuron’s input and output is sensitive to varies between neuron types.
These two components of the neuron interface via electrical voltage.
An action potential conducts information from the input component of the neuron to its output component.
The action potential is an enabling signal.
Information contained in the signal is minimized — binary on/off information is signified by the presence or absence of an action potential.
This arrangement allows input and output components to be freely mixed and matched in a single neuron.
The freedom to mix and match is enabled by the simple nature of the signal that interfaces the input and output components.
Thus, weak linkage makes a large number of viable neural configurations readily accessible to evolution [[Kirschner and Gerhart, 2005]](#Kirschner2005TheDilemma).
