Fitness Degeneracy
==================

Definition
----------

I define fitness degeneracy as the ability of divergent strategies for reproduction and survival to succeed in a particular environment.
From an evolutionary computing perspective, a fitness function would be considered to exhibit fitness degeneracy if a set of functionally different phenotypes can all attain high fitness.
This concept roughly corresponds to the idea of biological niches, but considers the ability of different strategies for reproduction and survival to succeed within a population (as opposed to between species).

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

By allowing for functionally divergent phenotypes to succeed, fitness degeneracy promotes the accumulation of diversity within a population.
This diversity broadens the range of phenotypic forms that are accessible to the offspring of a population, thus promoting population evolvability .
The coexistence of speciated populations within the same ecosystem that exploit radically different strategies to earn their metabolic keep can also be seen as fitness degeneracy.
This degeneracy, the ability of radically different fitness strategies to coexist within the biosphere, has vastly expanded the breadth of phenotypic form explored by evolution.

A related approach is to set a vast number of separate, diverse evolutionary objectives, which approximates the infinite number of niches created by the ever-changing natural world.
Such optimization leads to frequent goal-switching, as lineages fit on one objective invade other objectives, which rewards lineages that produce behaviorally diverse offspring and increases evolvability @Mengistu2016EvolvabilityIt

Example
-------

The male mating patterns of *Uta stansburiana*, a lizard found in the coast range of California, illustrates fitness degeneracy — how different strategies stemming from phenotypic diversity can be successful in terms of fitness.
Male *Uta stansburiana* are found in three morphs: orange, blue, and yellow @Sinervo1996TheStrategies.
The orange morph is characterized as “hyper-masculine.” It staunchly defends its territory and will battle male trespassers.
Lizards of the yellow morph are “sneakers.” They pass themselves off as females to get past other males.
The blue morph is described as the “mate-guarding” morph.
Blue morph lizards are more circumspect to combat and not as easily deceived by interloping yellow morphs.
Figure `lizards` provides a visual overview of how these morphs interact.
Much like the game of rock, paper, scissors, each morph outcompetes one morph and is itself outcompeted by another morph.
No single phenotypic strategy is favored by the environment.
Although their strategies for survival and reproduction vary greatly, each lizard morph can be successful.
