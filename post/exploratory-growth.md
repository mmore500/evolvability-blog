Exploratory Growth
==================

Definition
----------

Exploratory growth refers to the incorporation of search into the developmental process.
Instead of having developmental components grow to hard-coded proportions and in hard-coded locations, developmental processes incorporate information about the the current state of the organism into the developmental trajectories of system components @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 214].

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Because other systems in a developing organism can change to adapt to changes in one system, exploratory growth reduces the probability of mutations leading to catastrophic fitness decline or outright mortality.
Thus, exploratory growth promotes both canalization and robustness: translation of genetic changes into phenotypic effects are more likely to be resisted and, if they do occur, they are more likely to be viable because the development of the organism adapts to compensate for those changes.
As Downing argues, due to exploratory growth “the production of novel phenotypes does not require concerted change to many parts of the genome, a very low-probability combination of events, but rather a single change to a factor affecting an early phase of development.
The rest just grow to fit the altered context...” @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 214].

Example
-------

The structural components of the mammalian body develop in a “grow to fit” pattern.
The development of bones and muscles is defined by a process in which they seek out attachment sites defined by other components of the developing system.
These components “grow to fit” in the sense that they grow (or shrink) to fit an altered developmental context.
The final form of these structures is determined through exploration of the developmental environment @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [pg 214].
Mesychme cells, a cell type observed in animal embryos that is a precursor to several tissue types, provide another striking example of exploratory growth.
During embryological cellular migration, mesenchyme cells extend filopodia to explore their environment; several filopodia attach to different sites on the blastocoel wall, and the final position of the cell is determined from a tug-of-war between the filopodia — the mesenchyme cell will choose the site where it found most stable attachment.
In this way, exploration performed by mesychyme cells contributes to the development process @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [pg 214].

The development of the nervous system is heavily marked by exploratory growth.
In the brain, an excess of candidate neural networks are created during the development process.
Fledgling networks with insufficient connectivity to the rest of the network are then culled; essentially, the final components of the brain are derived of a much larger number of competing trial subnetworks, many of which are failures @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 214].
Ennervation of the body during development proceeds in a similar trial-and-error fashion.
Excess neurons migrate and extend processes to seek out and compete for targets; many are unsuccessful and, ultimately, die @Edelman2001DegeneracySystems.
