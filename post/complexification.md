Complexification
================

Definition
----------

Complexification refers to the development of sophisticated phenotypic functionality through the incremental refinement and elaboration over evolutionary time @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [pg 202].
In this process, a phenotypic structure results not from a single mutation event but instead from a sequential series of modifications, each building upon the last.
Many intermediate forms of the phenotypic feature are observed, with a trend towards increasing sophistication, are observed.
It should be noted that the stepping stones of complexification, intermediate phenotypic forms, need not share the same functionality.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Complexification biases evolutionary search towards viable variation.
In short, variants of already-existing phenotypic structures are more likely to be useful than randomly-generated phenotypic structures If existing phenotypic structures could not readily be elaborated upon, the chance of evolution happening upon viable variation would be vanishingly small.

The capacity of a genotype-phenotype mapping to accommodate complexification in evolutionary computing cannot be taken for granted.
Consider, for example, an evolving artificial neural network.
In this context, a network that starts out with very few nodes and adds nodes over the course of evolution — thus, developing a more complex phenotype — exhibits complexification @Clune2011OnRegularity.
Genetic encodings that encode phenotypes with a fixed number of nodes would be incapable of exhibiting this form of complexification.
The capacity genotype-phenotype mapping to accommodate complexification — its capacity to translate additions of genetic information into refinement of existing phenotypic features — will be key to achieving evolvability in evolutionary computing.

Example
-------

The evolution of the vertebrate eye epitomizes complexification.
It is thought that this structure evolved through a series of intermediates, beginning with a simple region of enervated photosensitive cells.
A folded-in, photosensitive pouch-like structure, which provided directional sensitivity, is thought to have arisen next.
Pinhole and lens structures, which provide greater visual acuity, are thought to have descended from the pouch structures @Gregory2008TheOrgans.
These intermediate phenotypic structures, each elaborating on an existing phenotypic form, can be observed in extant organisms as illustrated in Figure .

The complexification of vertebrate eyes was enabled by the nature of the biological genotype-phenotype mapping.
The biological genotype-phenotype mapping mapping is capable of accommodating increased amounts of genetic information describing an existing phenotypic trait and translating that new information into refinement of the existing phenotypic trait.
For example, in the transition from light sensitive patches to photosensitive pouches the genotype-phenotype mapping accommodated new information altering the shape of the surface in which light sensitive cells are embedded while preserving the general arrangement and connectivity of the light sensitive cells.
