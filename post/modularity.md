Modularity {#sec:modularity}
==========

Definition
----------

Modularity refers to the organization of a system into distinct subsystems where interaction between components of the subsystem outstrips interaction between components inside of a subsystem and components outside of it @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 207].
By distilling the system into compact units of independent functionality, modularity allows reuse of that functionality in different parts of the system through duplication @Reisinger2005TowardsEvolvability.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Downing argues convincingly for the utility of modularity,

Once structures or mechanisms are consolidated and isolated (to some degree) from external influences, their probability of disruption declines and their potential for self-modification without global repercussions increases: they enhance both robustness and adaptability @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 208]

The compartmentalization of functionality makes independent changes to one aspect of functionality possible while other aspects of functionality are preserved.
By increasing the robustness of other aspects of functionality in an organism to changes in one aspect of functionality, modularity ultimately biases evolutionary search space towards viable offspring.
Further, compartmentalization of functionality allows for re-use of that functionality in another context in the system.
Because complete units of phenotypic functionality are more likely to be useful in new contexts than randomly generated structures, modularity allows for the generation of divergent phenotypes (i.e.
diverse offspring) that are likely to be viable.
In this way, modularity promotes complexification.

Example
-------

The segregated cell roles in multicellular organisms provides an excellent example of modularity.
Consider, in particular, simple squamous epithelial tissue.
This tissue cells are typically constitutes regions of membrane requiring rapid diffusion or filtration.
The tissueâ€™s self-contained structure facilitates the reuse of its functionality across many different parts of the body.
Simple squamous epithelial tissue appears in a diverse set of anatomical contexts including the air sacs of lungs, the walls of capillaries, and the kidneys @Owens2003TheKeratins.
