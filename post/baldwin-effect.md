Baldwin Effect
==============

Definition
----------

The Baldwin effect postulates that local search in the phenotype space biases evolutionary search to allow advantageous phenotypic features originally acquired via phenotypic plasticity to be encoded into the genetic representation @Downing2010TheNetworks.
In the first phase of the Baldwin effect, advantageous phenotypic features discovered by local search in the phenotype space increase the fitness of individuals proximal to that phenotype.
In the second phase of the Baldwin effect, continued evolutionary search encodes phenotypic features originally discovered by phenotypic plasticity into the genetic representation.

The first phase of the Baldwin effect is driven by local phenotypic search.
This concept is illustrated in Figure `baldwin_effect`, where the phenotype space is depicted as a three dimensional surface with points on the surface representing different phenotypes and the height of the surface denoting the fitness of the phenotypes at those points.
In the illustration, the dark blue square represents the phenotype originally mapped to by the genetic representation of an individual, the blue shaded region represents the region of the phenotype space searched via phenotypic plasticity, and the red star represents a high fitness phenotypic variant reached via phenotypic plasticity.
The fitness boost gained from phenotypic proximity to a high fitness solution biases evolutionary search to continue exploring that region instead of proceeding in other directions.

Cost or unreliability of generating the advantageous phenotypic feature via phenotypic plasticity provides evolutionary pressure that favors genetic encoding of that phenotypic feature, driving the second phase of the Baldwin effect.
In the case of indirect genotype to phenotype mappings, a direct genetic encoding of the feature discovered via phenotypic plasticity might not exist; however, genomes that map to phenotypes closer to the phenotypic feature discovered by plasticity — which support attainment of the phenotypic feature by reducing the cost or increasing the reliability of acquiring that feature via plasticity, providing “scaffolding” for the local phenotypic search — may still arise and will be selected for @Downing2012HeterochronousBaldwinism.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

By allowing a candidate solution to assume proximal phenotypic forms, local phenotypic search allows evolutionary selection to act on information about a candidate solution’s local phenotypic neighborhood.
Through selective pressure for phenotypes proximal to high-fitness phenotypic forms, local phenotypic search “buys evolutionary time” until heritable scaffolding arises to support phenotypic adaptation originally attained via plasticity @Downing2010TheNetworks.

Example
-------

The Baldwin Effect has been hypothesized to play a role in mammalian brain evolution.
Learning is thought to play the role of local phenotypic search @Downing2010TheNetworks.
In the first phase of the Baldwin Effect, advantageous brain organizational traits would have been achieved by learning.
Individuals capable of achieving these traits by learning would exhibit greater fitness.
This fitness reward allowed individuals with a baseline capacity to achieve advantageous brain organizational traits by learning to persist.
Downing claims that over evolutionary time the processes of neurogenesis, synapogenesis, and synaptic tuning have shifted away from the postnatal life phase, becoming increasingly concentrated in the prenatal developmental developmental phase @Downing2012HeterochronousBaldwinism.
More simply put, brain organization activity retracted into the initial embryological phase of life.
The phenotype is generally considered to be more strongly governed by genetic influences (as opposed to environmental influences) during the embryological phase relative to later phases of life.
The retraction of brain organization activity brain into the initial embryological phase of life thus corresponds to the second phase of the Baldwin Effect, a shift towards stronger genetic influence on traits related to brain organization originally discovered by local phenotypic search.
Under this hypothesis, brain structures that were originally obtained by learning (local phenotypic search) became increasingly encoded in the genotype.
