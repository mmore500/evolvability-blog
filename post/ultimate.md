Establishing the ultimate cause of a phenomenon can easily devolve into a fraught and ill-defined endeavor.
A bicycle rider noticing decreasing return on her pedaling effort would very well wonder what is wrong with the bike.
Perhaps the tire is flat.
Why is the tire flat? Perhaps a shard of glass punctured it.
Why? Perhaps the biker’s commute goes through a derelict neighborhood.
Why? The answer to that question lies somewhere in urban history and zoning ordinance.
This process could be continued.
Often, there is no clearly defined top rung on the ladder of causality.
Instead, causal hypotheses become increasingly obscure, eventually escaping the realm of science and slipping into that of philosophy or religion.
Practical considerations can help to resolve this dilemma by informing a clear point at which to stop climbing and declare an ultimate cause.
In terms of our biker, the route of her commute provides a clear avenue for intervention.
Perhaps she should avoid biking through that seedy district.

Similar practical considerations inform organization of this section.
High level causal factors that might be practically employed to promote evolvability in evolutionary computing were included.
These causal factors frequently act by promoting the traits discussed in Chapter \[sec:intermediate\] that manifest in the proximal causes, phenotypic characteristics observed in biological organisms, presented in Section \[sec:proximate\].
While the contents of this section might hold the greatest direct practical relevance to researchers seeking to promote evolvability in artificial systems, it should not be viewed as a comprehensive listing of approaches to promoting evolvability in those systems.
As will be overviewed in Chapter \[sec:discussion\], some techniques devised by evolutionary computing researchers do not have a direct analog in nature, although many are inspired by the principles of nature’s evolvability-promoting toolbox.
Hopefully, this vantage on the roots evolvability, although inspired by the practical considerations of evolutionary computing, by considering how certain fundamental characteristics of biology promote evolvability will also prove satisfying to the biologically-motivated reader.
