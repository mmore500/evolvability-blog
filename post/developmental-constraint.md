Developmental Constraint
========================

Definition
----------

Developmental constraint refers to the influence of the development process on the distribution of phenotypic forms that can be generated in the offspring of an individual [[Smith et al., 1985]](#Smith1985DevelopmentalBiology).
The concept of developmental constraint rests upon the idea that certain phenotypic forms are more likely to arise because they are more readily generated by physicochemical processes that underpin embryological development [[Smith et al., 1985]](#Smith1985DevelopmentalBiology).
Because the genotype is interpreted into phenotypic form in large part through the developmental system, the phenotypic outcomes of mutation are closely linked to the configuration of the developmental system.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Developmental constraint might restrict nonadaptive variation, biasing evolutionary search towards viable phenotypes [[Downing, 2015, p 40]]](#Downing2015IntelligenceSystems).
Developmental constraint that funnels phenotypic variation towards viability contributes to canalization (Section \[sec:canalization\]).
However, developmental constraints may also be arbitrary.
For example, centipedes exhibit an apparent constraint towards developing an odd number of body segments [[Arthur and Malcolm Farrow, 1999]](#Arthur1999TheEvolution).
Thus, developmental constraint can, but need not necessarily, contribute to canalization.

Example
-------

Artificial selection experiments performed by several laboratories on *Drosophila melangoster* revealed developmental constraint towards bilateral symmetry.
Artificial selection experiments on symmetrically distributed traits (i.e.
overall eye size, overall bristle count, etc.) *Drosophila melangoster* have a high rate of success.
However, artificial selection for left-right traits generally fails.
For example, artificial selection experiments were unable to introduce an asymmetric bias in thorasic bristle counts despite many generations of selection.
Although phenotypic variation in left-right thorasic bristle number existed in the population, that variation was not heritable.
Similar results have been reported in relation to artificial selection for asymmetric distribution of eye size [[Coyne, 1987]](#Coyne1987LackMelanogaster), eye facet number [[Manyard Smith and Sondhi, 1960]](#ManyardSmith1960ThePattern), and wing-folding behavior [[Purnell and Thompson, 1973]](#Purnell1973SelectionMelanogaster) in *Drosophila melanogaster*.
Tuinstra et al.
hypothesize that this canalization results from the developmental process, “as no evidence is available for an independent left-right gradient in the embryo, quantitative traits can only be expressed variably along an existing gradient of positional information or a morphagen“ [[Tuinstra et al., 1990]](#Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment).
It seems that the nature of the developmental process makes heritable variation for bilaterally asymmetric traits in *Drosophila* more difficult to come by.
A cartoon summarizing the outcome of these experiments is provided in Figure `fly_canalization`.
