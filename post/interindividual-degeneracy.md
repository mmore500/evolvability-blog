Interindividual Degeneracy
==========================

Definition
----------

I define interindividual degeneracy as the presence of phenotypically dissimilar individuals in a population that, despite those dissimilarities, interact with their environment in identical or near-identical ways (i.e.
are functionally equivalent).
Interindividual degeneracy is related to the idea of diversity but specifically refers to phenotypic diversity that is functionally interchangeable.
Although structurally divergent, individuals in a population that exhibits interindividual degeneracy are functionally similar.

Interindividual degeneracy can be seen as stemming from tolerance of the phenotype-fitness mapping for certain types of phenotypic variation.
That is, certain aspects of phenotypic form are inconsequential to fitness.

Interindividual degeneracy can also be seen as stemming from robustness.
Robustness enables a biological system to maintain function despite variations to some aspect of phenotypic form.
(Without robustness, overall function of an organism would be more likely to be negatively impacted by variation in a particular aspect of phenotypic form).

Although distinct from intraindividual degeneracy, intraindividual degeneracy might bolster interindividual degeneracy by providing bountiful opportunities for neutral variation to manifest.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Similar to how intraindividual degeneracy promotes individual evolvability, population degeneracy promotes population evolvability.
Succinctly put, by providing a wider array of jumping-off points, the presence of structurally divergent individuals in a population increases the variety of phenotypic forms that can be realized in the offspring of that population.

Example
-------

Earlobe attachment in *Homo sapiens sapiens* provides an illustrative example of interindividual degeneracy.
This phenotypic trait is distributed over a spectrum between attachment and detachment.
The extremes of this spectrum are illustrated in Figure `earlobe`.
This trait is widely understood to be genetically determined @Dutta1979EarlobeAssam.
This element of phenotypic diversity, which occurs in both forms within populations around the world, seems to be functionally neutral.
That is, the trait does not affect how an individual interacts with his or her environment to determine his or her fitness.
Hence, diversity in earlobe attachment represents interindividual degeneracy.
