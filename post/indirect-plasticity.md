Indirect Plasticity
===================

Definition
----------

Indirect plasticity is specifically related to environmental influences more akin to informational signals than coercive physical influences.
An organism in which these environmental signals prompt responses that are mediated by physiological or developmental systems exhibit indirect plasticity.
This term describes the ability of an organism to receive, process, and respond to environmental information through adjustments to its own phenotype @Fusco2010PhenotypicConcepts.
At a fundamental level, successful indirect plasticity entails strategic *amplification* of certain aspects of environmental influence on the phenotype.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Researchers have suggested that phenotypic modularity might be a key contributor to indirect plasticity, especially in plants @Schlichting1986ThePlants [@DeKroon2005APlants].
Thus, selection for indirect plasticity, which is known to play an important role in adaptation to an unpredictable or variable environment @Fusco2010PhenotypicConcepts, might promote modularity.

Conditional expression of phenotypic traits through plasticity allows for relaxed selection on the genotypic locus determining those traits.
Thus, significant genetic variation can accumulate at that locus in a population.
In a process known as genetic accommodation, the environmental influence on when rarely-expressed phenotypic traits are expressed can be diminished or erased through sensitizing mutation; what once was induced via environmental signal can become constitutive.
Such processes have been observed experimentally via artificial selection @Moczek2011TheInnovation.

Finally, the role plastic processes such as learning might play in concert with phenotypic regularity is an open question.
It is possible that phenotypic remodeling induced via environmental cues may provide a mechanism of irregular refinement of highly regular phenotypic structures generated via development.
That is, interaction of an individual with its environment may induce irregular phenotypic adjustments which increase fitness @Clune2011OnRegularity.

Example
-------

Tadpoles of *Spea multiplicata*, which is also known as the Mexican spadefoot toad, develop along two alternate trajectories in response to environmental signals.
The two tadpole morphs of *Spea multiplicata*, depicted in Figure `spea_multiplicata` exhibit different jaw and digestive tract configurations and prefer different diets @Fusco2010PhenotypicConcepts.
One morph is specially suited to an carnivorous diet while the other is suited to an omnivorous one@Pfennig1992PolyphenismStrategy.

While *Spea multiplicata* illustrate phenotypic plasticity in development, phenotypic plasticity — although often more subtle — also manifests on an ongoing basis throughout the lifespan of most creatures.
*E.
coli* provide a textbook example of phenotypic alteration in response to environmental stimulus.
These bacteria selectively express an enzyme used in the digestion of lactose, $\beta$-galactosidase in the presence of lactose when alternate food sources, such as glucose, are unavailable.
This phenotypic change is mutable; in the absence of lactose or the presence of glucose production of $\beta$-galactosidase halts @Griffiths2015IntroductionAnalysis.
