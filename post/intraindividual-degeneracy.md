Intraindividual Degeneracy
==========================

Definition
----------

Degeneracy refers to the exhibition of similar functionality by structurally different systems @Edelman2001DegeneracySystems.
For example, one might refer to push doors, rotating doors, and sliding doors as degenerate; although they all accomplish similar tasks, they are structurally dissimilar.

In an organism exhibiting intraindividual degeneracy, distinct components with different structures perform the same function.
Degenerate components are functionally, but not structurally, redundant.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Intraindividual degeneracy is thought to be key to the evolvability observed in biology.
Intraindividual degeneracy provides a solution to the seemingly paradoxical relationship between robustness (Section \[sec:robustness\]) and evolutionary innovation, the ability to generate heritable novel variation @Whitacre2010Degeneracy:Evolvability.
How can a system have both robustness, which constrains change to the system, and innovation? Intraindividual degeneracy seems to be the answer.
By having multiple independent components that perform the same task, the system is secured against the failure of one of the components and, therefore, more likely to persist under extreme environmental conditions due to the diverse response of the degenerate components to those conditions @Whitacre2010Degeneracy:Evolvability.
However, intraindividual degeneracy also provides a diverse set of phenotypic structures that can be repurposed or elaborated upon.
Essentially, intraindividual degeneracy protects against loss of function mutations, which are often deleterious, while providing ample jumping off points to generate novel phenotypic function.
In this way, intraindividual degeneracy promotes individual evolvability.

Intraindividual degeneracy is also thought to be related to direct plasticity.
Under different circumstances — such as unusual environmental stress — the functionality of degenerate components might diverge due to their structural differences @Richter2015EvolvabilitySurvey.
The presence of degenerate components, each of which might be able to maintain functionality under environmental stresses that would neutralize the other components, increases the range of environmental perturbations that a organism might be able to withstand.

Example
-------

Mammalian deoxyribonucleoside kinases serve as a prime example of intraindividual degeneracy.
Mammalian deoxyribonucleoside kinases are enzymes that process the precursors to DNA.
As shown in Figure `intraindividual_degeneracy`, these enzymes act on four substrates: dT, dC, dA, and DG.
These kinases are said exemplify degeneracy because each unit of functionality, the chemical processing of each of the four precursors, is accomplished by two structurally unique components.
Processing of the compound dT, in particular, is accomplished via both TK1 and TK2, enzymes from different protein families that fundamentally differ in structural composition.
The ability of an organism to metabolize the dT DNA precursor is thus more robust to perturbations that disable one of Tk1 or Tk2.
Additionally, Tk1 and Tk2 both serve as jumping-off points for evolutionary innovation via the repurposing of either enzyme.
