Direct Plasticity
=================

Definition
----------

Plasticity, in general, refers to environmental influence on the phenotype.
In biology, environmental and genetic influences, together, shape the phenotype.
Environmental influences may alter the trajectory of the developmental process or may otherwise induce phenotype changes in response to environmental stimulus [[Fusco and Minelli, 2010]](#Fusco2010PhenotypicConcepts).

Direct plasticity plasticity is specifically related to environmental influence that is exerted directly and coercively on developmental or physiological processes.
An organism that exhibits direct plasticity is robust to these environmental perturbations.
At a fundamental level, successful direct plasticity entails *resistance* to environmental influence on the phenotype.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

It is thought that the homeostatic mechanisms that mediate an organism’s interactions with its environment (i.e.
the mechanisms that support to direct plasticity) might also promote robustness to mutation [[Moczek et al., 2011]](#Moczek2011TheInnovation).
That is, the same traits that help an individual maintain functionality under environmental perturbation may also help protect the individual against catastrophically deleterious mutational outcomes.

Example
-------

Osmotic pressure, generated via the diffusion of water into a cell due to a disparate solute concentrations inside and outside a cell, constitutes a grave threat to biological cells.
Unchecked, this coercive physical influence may indeed burst a cell, such as an animal erythrocyte [[Lodish et al., 2000]](#Lodish2000OsmosisVolume).
Such cells, unable to withstand disruptive environmental physical influences, would be said to exhibit poor direct plasticity in that regard.
Many biological organisms do, however, exhibit strong direct plasticity with respect to osmotic pressure.
Plant, algal, fungal, and bacterial cells use a rigid cell wall to withstand osmotic pressures.
Many protozoa cope with osmotic influx of water by capturing excess fluid in the cytosol in a contractile vacuole that is occasionally discharged into the extracellular environment [[Lodish et al., 2000]](#Lodish2000OsmosisVolume).
