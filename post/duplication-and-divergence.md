Duplication and Divergence {#sec:duplication_and_divergence}
==========================

Definition
----------

Duplication and divergence refers to a two step process thought to be essential to the evolution of new genes in biology.
In the first step, duplication, the genetic information coding for a phenotypic feature is duplicated in the genome.
In the second step, divergence, one of the gene copies is modified by mutation.

Example
-------

Homeobox genes provide a canonical example of duplication and differentiation in action.
These genes, which lay out the body plan of a developing embryo, have been duplicated and differentiated many times, at each step adding novel body plan features @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 203].
In particular, Homeobox genes have seen re-use in determining brain segmentation.
Fascinating parallels can be drawn between the the topology of the brain and an animal body plan @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 201].

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Duplication and divergence allows for re-use of evolved functionality.
It is much more tractable to achieve sophisticated functionality by modification of existing biological components, for which evolution has already worked out most of the kinks, than starting from scratch.
Further, duplication and divergence can jump start the evolution of new functionality without disrupting the functionality originally encoded in the genome.
The original gene is preserved.
By allowing gene evolution to fork out to achieve a widening array of functionality, duplication and divergence paves a tractable route to gradual phenotypic complexification @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 202].
