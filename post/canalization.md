Canalization {#sec:canalization}
============

Definition
----------

Canalization refers to “organizing the effects of mutations such that some features become more resistant to change” @Reisinger2005TowardsEvolvability.
Canalization can stem from many aspects of phenotypic form and the phenotype-genotype mapping.
For example, developmental constraint is associated with canalization.
Importantly, canalization can be selective — some phenotypic features become more resistant to change than others.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Canalization can provide selective bias against inviable phenotypic outcomes while still allowing for viable phenotypic variability.
Thus, canalization contributes directly to one of the major components of evolvability: bias towards viable variation.
Through this bias towards viable variation, canalization contributes to an increase in the overall quality of offspring to be selected from @Downing2015IntelligenceSystems [p 40].

Example
-------

Developmental constraint is a form of canalization.
The developmental constraint revealed by artificial selection experiments performed on *Drosophila melanogaster* illustrate canalization well.
These experiments, presented in Section \[sec:fly\_symmetry\], revealed heritable bilaterally symmetric phenotypic variation is more readily accessible than bilaterally asymmetric variation.
Hence, *Drosophila* exhibits canalization against systematic asymmetry.
