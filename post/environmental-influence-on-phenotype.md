Environmental Influence on Phenotype
====================================

Definition
----------

The mantra $P = G + E$, stating that phenotype is a product of both genotype and environment, has come to be universally accepted among biologists.
On a basic level, it is clear that, because biological organisms do not exist in a vacuum, they are physically influenced by their environments.
Temperature, chemical substances, electromagnetic radiation, and other external physical phenomena directly act upon biological organisms.

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Environmental influence on the phenotype is included as an ultimate cause of evolvability because of an idea that is a bit more subtle: that these environmental factors might play an important role in the evolutionary process.
Environmental influence on the phenotype can be divided into two major categories: disruptive noise and information.
That is, certain aspects of the physical interaction of an organism with its environment can be considered as disruptive perturbations that an organism must be robust to.
This type of environmental influence is related to direct plasticity, an intermediate causal factor presented in \[sec:direct\_plasticity\].
Other aspects of the physical interaction of an organism with its environment might be considered as providing information to the organism that it can exploit in order to increase its fitness.
This type of environmental influence is related to indirect plasticity, another intermediate causal factor presented in \[sec:indirect\_plasticity\].

Example
-------

Himalayan rabbits provide a charismatic example of environmental influence on the phenotype.
These rabbits carry a gene that produces melanin, giving their fur a brown color.
However, this gene is only active at temperatures significantly below body temperature so the brown coloration is typically only observed on the outer extremities of the rabbit.
If a Himalayan rabbit is reared at a temperature above the threshold for melanin creation, however, the gene will be inactivated throughout the rabbits body and a pure white phenotype will be observed @Lobo2008EnvironmentalExpresssion.
