Hidden Genetic Variation
========================

Definition
----------

Hidden genetic variation, also known as cryptic variation or neutral variation, refers to genetic diversity in a population that does not manifest as phenotypic diversity.
In biological systems, many genotypes map to a identical or nearly identical phenotypes.
This many-to-one relationship may be due to the presence of variation in non-coding DNA, variation in genes for which phenotypic effects are suppressed by regulatory mechanisms, or degeneracy in the genetic code (i.e.
several codons encoding the same amino acid residue).
It is thought that the homeostatic mechanisms that promote robustness facilitate hidden genetic variation by counteracting the phenotypic changes that might be induced by some forms of genetic variation [[[Moczek et al., 2011]](#Moczek2011TheInnovation).
Environmental influence on the phenotype might contribute to an intermediate form of cryptic variation where a trait is expressed phenotypically in only a subset of the population due to differences in environmental conditions.
Such a trait would therefore be somewhat hidden from phenotypic expression [[[Moczek et al., 2011]](#Moczek2011TheInnovation).

Relation to Evolvability
------------------------

Because cryptic genetic variation is not selected upon by evolution, it can accumulate in a population.
This accumulated genetic variation is thought to promote evolutionary innovation [[Wilder and Stanley, 2015]](#Wilder2015ReconcilingEvolvability) several ways.
By allowing for a broader distribution of a population through a genotype space, cryptic variation increases the phenotypic diversity that can be realized in offspring from the population because individuals in the population can “access radically different phenotypes in their immediate mutational neighborhood” [[Wilder and Stanley, 2015]](#Wilder2015ReconcilingEvolvability).
Cryptic variation is also thought to allow for larger steps to be taken in the mutational search space during evolutionary search.
Significant accumulated cryptic variation can rapidly switch to being expressed through a sensitizing mutation or environmental change  [[[Moczek et al., 2011]](#Moczek2011TheInnovation).

Example
-------

Work with strains of the model organism *Drosophila melanogaster* possessing the mutation *Scute* has unmasked elements of hidden genetic variation in wild type *Drosophila* [[Wagner, 2003]](Wagner2003EvolutionaryUnveiled).
The mutation *Scute* increases the number of bristles observed on *Drosophila* and, more intriguingly, also boosts the variability in bristle count observed between individuals.
*Scute* mutants exhibit exhibit more variability in bristle counts than wild type *Drosophila* by several orders of magnitude.
Artificial selection experiments revealed a stronger response in the mutant populations to selection for bristle counts than in wild type populations.
Thus, some of the variation of the *Scute* mutant phenotype seems to have a heritable genetic basis.
It is hypothesized that the mutation *Scute* sensitized *Drosophila melanogaster* to existing genetic variation.
The experiments demonstrated “genetic variation for the character that is not expressed in the wild type, but becomes visible in the mutant background” [[Wagner, 2003]](Wagner2003EvolutionaryUnveiled).
In other words, the mutation *Scute* revealed previously hidden genetic variation for bristle count.
