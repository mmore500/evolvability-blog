The robustness of biological organisms, the ability to persist under a range of environmental conditions, is well understood by scientists, and envied by engineers.
Students of human physiology drown in the plethora of mechanisms through which the body acts to counter any number of disruptive influences in its relentless pursuit of homeostasis.
When blood sugar spikes, pancreatic cells respond by releasing insulin to prompt absorption of glucose from the bloodstream.
When ambient temperature decreases, capillaries below the surface of the skin close to prevent loss of heat through the skin, evaporative cooling through sweating ceases, and a shivering reflex in skeletal muscles is triggered to spur heat production [[Guyton, 1971]](#Guyton1971BasicDisease) [[Benzinger, 1969]](#Benzinger1969HeatMan).
Alter most any aspect of the body or its environment within reasonable bounds, and an array of biological systems spring into reaction.

Similar processes are at play in embryological development, cushioning that process against internal hiccups and external interference.
The plasma membranes of embryological cells are known to be resilient to strain and perforation.
Disruption of the barrier between the cell and its surroundings leads to an influx of calcium ions, which induce rapid incorporation of waiting intracellular vesicles at the site of the leak.
These vesicles patch over the damage, allowing the cell to survive and continue along its proper developmental trajectory [[Hamdoun and Epel, 2007]](#Hamdoun2007EmbryoWorld).
Embryological development exhibits robustness at a broader scope, as well.
Consider the processes that lay out the body plan of *Drosophila melanogaster*.
In this organism, anterior-posterior directional information is broadcast to developing *Drosophila* cells through a concentration gradient of the morphogen bicoid.
However, proper organization of body segments are maintained over a range of temperatures, across which bicoid distribution is known to be disrupted.
The mechanisms that account for this surprising maintenance of fidelity to the proper body plan, as of 2007, have not been definitively established [[Hamdoun and Epel, 2007]](#Hamdoun2007EmbryoWorld).

However, not all biological components and subsystems — in embryos and beyond — are configured to suppress variability in phenotypic form.
In response to seasonal cues, butterflies are known to alternatively suppress or activate expression of a pronounced eye spot.
*Daphia*, better known as water fleas, are known to modulate the fortitude of their immune system based on the amount of infectious bacteria mothers encounter during reproduction [[Hamdoun and Epel, 2007]](#Hamdoun2007EmbryoWorld).
Metabolic processes in adult rats are contingent on nutritive conditions encountered during embryological development.
Rats whose mothers were kept on a restricted diet during pregnancy tend to gain more weight when exposed to high-calorie diets than rats whose mothers had better access to food [[Wilson, 2007, p 57]](#Wilson2007EvolutionLives).
A similar embryological decision-making approach is at play in male dung beetles, which develop along alternate trajectories — one displaying a horned forehead in adulthood and the other displaying a naked forehead in adulthood — depending on their body size at a certain juncture of infancy.
Horns are thought to be most useful to beetles capable of levying significant bulk against romantic competitors and are otherwise superfluous [[Wilson, 2007, p 47]](#Wilson2007EvolutionLives).

Biological organisms are predisposed to minimize some types of phenotypic variability and to allow, or even encourage, other variability in other phenotypic dimensions.
The systems and subsystems that regulate variability often persist under mild mutative perturbation.
Thus, these systems and subsystems act upon the mutative perturbation and mold the phenotypic effects that result from the mutation.
Some phenotypic changes are suppressed while others are tolerated.

Proximal causality of evolvability results from the relationship between the phenotypic form of biological organisms and the phenotypic changes that can manifest as a result from mutation.
Kirschner et al.
zero in on this idea, emphasizing that — although genotypic mutation is essentially an arbitrarily random process — “phenotypic variation cannot be random because it involves modification of what already exists” [[Kirschner and Gerhart, 2005, p 220]](#Kirschner2005TheDilemma).
I agree with the sentiment of this observation, however the precision of the language Kirschner et al.
use could be improved.
They use the word random to express an idea that could be better termed as unconstrained or arbitrary randomness.
Ultimately, phenotypic variation results from genetic perturbation, which is random and arbitrary.
The key observation that Kirschner et al.
have made, and which will be presented in this section, is that while phenotypic variation is stochastic, it is not arbitrary.
This section aims to highlight how design patterns common in biological organisms transform random mutation into structured phenotypic variation.
A good amount of material presented in this section is framed by or drawn from the Theory of Facilitated Variation, originally presented in [[Kirschner and Gerhart, 2005]](#Kirschner2005TheDilemma), as reported in [[Downing, 2015]](#Downing2015IntelligenceSystems).
