Introductory Glimpses of Evolvability for Biologists
====================================================

How can biological organisms bias the distribution of phenotypic outcomes observed under mutation?
We will look at two examples.

Experiments performed by [Tuinstra et al., 1990](#Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment) and [Coyne, 1987](#Coyne1987LackMelanogaster) revealed that bilaterally asymmetric phenotypic traits, such as different-sized eyes, could not be induced through artificial selection.
In contrast, other artificial selection criteria, such as overall smaller eyes, yielded observable phenotypic changes over the course of a number of generations.
A cartoon summarizing these results is provided in Figure 1.
The success of artificial selection for most traits on *Drosophila* demonstrates the existence of a good amount of heritable phenotypic variation for those traits.
It is hypothesized that the negative result in artificial selection for bilaterally asymmetric phenotypic traits is due to a lack of bilateral symmetry-breaking information during the embryological development of *Drosophila*.
In other words, the very nature of the developmental process constrains the nature of phenotypic variation that can be observed in offspring, in this case curtailing the abundance of offspring that lack bilateral symmetry.
As [Tuinstra et al.
(1990)](#Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment) phrase it, “the developmental system does not seem to allow this type of variation.” In the life of a fly, buzzing about in search of food and sex, bilateral symmetry is usually more fit than asymmetry.
In this way, the distribution of phenotypic diversity in offspring is biased away from a particular type of deleterious variation, asymmetry.
The results from these artificial selection experiments can be cast in terms of evolvability: the distribution of phenotypic outcomes of mutation is not entirely arbitrary.
*Drosophila melangoster* more readily exhibits heritable phenotypic variation for certain traits — overall eye size, for example — than for other traits, such as bilateral asymmetry.

In addition to qualities that constrain against non-viable mutational outcomes, discussion of evolvability is predicated on the notion that biological organisms can possess qualities that facilitate significant heritable variation for some phenotypic trait.
The regulatory action of hormonal signals such as somatotropin exemplify such a quality.
This compound, also known as growth hormone, is well known for its widespread anabolic effects on tissues throughout the body.
Mutations affecting the regulatory pathways that regulate somatotropin production and release, receptors and cell signaling components that mediate cellular response to somatotropin, and the protein itself all provide avenues for significant heritable variation in body size [[Devesa et al., 2016]](#Devesa2016MultipleGrowth).[^1] The presence of such hormonal signaling pathways could be viewed as making a broad range of heritable phenotypic variation more readily realizable via mutation, increasing individual evolvability.
Dog breeds, which exhibit a range of body weights nearly spanning an entire order of magnitude, evidence the accessibility of heritable variation for body size in animals.
Among certain groups of dogs, much of this variation can be explained by just six genes, several of which are associated with pathways somatotropin participates in [[Rimbault et al., 2013]](#Rimbault2013DerivedBreeds).

[^1]: Recent research implicates somatotropin in a number of processes unrelated to its classical association with metabolism and growth.
Although the phenotypic consequences of mutations affecting somatotropin pathways are not exclusively limited to body size, somatotropin response nonetheless provides an avenue for heritable phenotypic variation in that regard.
